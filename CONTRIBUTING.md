# Join the Open Source Data Warehouse Benchmark Project

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

We welcome contributions from **anyone**—whether you're a data engineer, analyst, researcher, or enthusiast. This benchmark is meant to be **semi-technical and user-friendly**, so please help us keep it simple and accessible.

## How You Can Help

- Add benchmark scripts for new data warehouses not listed here.
- Add example datasets or queries.
- Write or improve documentation.
- Improve visualizations or result summaries.
- Suggest or add useful metrics or performance dimensions (e.g., cost, latency, query complexity).
- Report issues or bugs.

## Guidelines

To ensure the project stays friendly to semi-technical users:

- **Avoid complex class hierarchies** or deeply nested abstractions.
- Use **straightforward, readable Python** (or SQL), preferably declarative-style.
- Keep scripts and functions well-commented.
- If you’re adding a new script or file, explain it in the `README.md` or provide a docstring.
- External dependencies should be minimal and documented in `requirements.txt`.
